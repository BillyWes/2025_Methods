This file contains declarations regarding the use of AI for code generation and/or AI assisted coding (the use of AI for bug-fixing or for checking/generating small sections of code).
Although the majority of code was not AI-generated, some where 'no AI was used in the generation of this code' may contain AI-generated sections copy-pasted from other AI-generated scripts.
Where AI was used, ChatGPT (model: GPT3) was used with the standard model.
